        <h2>What can I afford?</h2>
        <p>This is a difficult question to answer, but generally depends on a few areas:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your deposit size</li>
            <li>Your income</li>
            <li>Your credit score</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Your deposit size</h3>
        <p>The larger your deposit, the lower risk you are to someone considering offering you a mortgage. The larger the deposit, the lower the interest rate you'll pay on your mortgage.</p>
        <p>The sweet spot for deposit sizes is 15% of the market value of your property. The higher the better, but this tends to be the point where you can pick up a comparatively lower mortgage rate, which will reduce the amount you'll repay each month in interest. The table below shows you a typical interest rate you can expect with different deposit sizes.</p>
        <table>
          <caption>Deposit Sizes and Interest Rate</caption>

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <h3>Your income</h3>
        <p>A general rule is that you typically borrow around four and a half times your annual salary.</p>
